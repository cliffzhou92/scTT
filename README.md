# scTT
 single-cell Transition Tensor
----
We present a single-cell transition tensor (scTT) method based on multi-stable attractor theory to integrate the multiple time-scale dynamics of gene expression, mRNA splicing and cell state-transitions, and rank the genes that characterizes the multi-stability. Overall, scTT provides a consistent dynamical description of single-cell transcriptome data across multiple scales. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46710747/189604786-0cb50f4c-d049-42ca-b49c-bec2fb733d78.png)
