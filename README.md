# scTT
---
We present a single-cell transition tensor (scTT) method based on multi-stable attractor theory to integrate the multiple time-scale dynamics of gene expression, mRNA splicing and cell state-transitions, and rank the genes that characterizes the multi-stability. Overall, scTT provides a consistent dynamical description of single-cell transcriptome data across multiple scales.
